## PART 1: Google Analytics – Get Started and Track Your Swedish Visitors

**What You'll Learn:**

1. Set up Google Analytics to accurately track your website traffic from Sweden.
2. Understand key metrics like Sessions, Users, and Bounce Rate.
3. Identify your top performing pages and understand user behavior.


### Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account and Property

If you don't already have one, create a Google Analytics account.  You'll need a Google account.  Once logged in, go to analytics.google.com and click "Admin."  Click "+ Create Property."  Enter your website URL and select the appropriate industry. Ensure you accurately fill in your business information, including your location as Sweden.

### Step 2: Install the Google Analytics Tracking Code (gtag.js)

Google Analytics needs a tracking code snippet to function.  This code should be placed within the `<head>` section of every page on your website.  Google provides clear instructions on how to do this, often involving your website's CMS (Content Management System) or working directly with your website's HTML code.  Failure to implement this correctly will mean Analytics won't track any data.

### Step 3: Configure Google Analytics for Swedish Visitors

To focus on your Swedish audience, use the following features:

* **Audience > Geo > Location:** This report will show you traffic sources and user demographics based on location. Filter by "Country" and select "Sweden" to see your Swedish website traffic.
* **Audience > Demographics & Interests > Overview:** This section will provide you with insights into the age, gender, and interests of your Swedish visitors.

### Step 4: Analyze Key Metrics

Understanding these metrics is crucial:

* **Sessions:** A session is a group of interactions that take place on your website within a given timeframe.  A single user can have multiple sessions.
* **Users:** The total number of unique users who visited your website.
* **Bounce Rate:** The percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing only one page.  A high bounce rate indicates potential issues with your website content or user experience.
* **Average Session Duration:** The average time users spend on your website during a session.
* **Pages/Session:** The average number of pages a user views during a single session.

Regularly monitor these metrics to identify trends and areas for improvement.


**Do Now:**

1. Create a Google Analytics account and property for your website.
2. Install the Google Analytics tracking code correctly.
3. Analyze your initial data and focus on your Swedish audience using the geographical filters.


## PART 2: Search Console – Improve Your Google Visibility

**What You'll Learn:**

1. Submit your website to Google Search Console for better indexing.
2. Identify and fix technical SEO issues impacting your ranking.
3. Monitor your website's performance in Google search results.


### Step 1: Verify Ownership of Your Website in Search Console

Go to searchconsole.google.com and add your website. Google will guide you through the verification process, usually involving adding a meta tag to your website's HTML or uploading an HTML file to your server.


### Step 2: Submit Your Sitemap for Better Indexing

A sitemap is an XML file that lists all the pages on your website. Submitting it to Search Console helps Google discover and index your pages more efficiently.  Generate your sitemap using your CMS or a third-party tool and then submit it through the Search Console interface.


### Step 3: Analyze Search Queries and Click-Through Rate (CTR)

The "Search Queries" report shows the keywords people use to find your website on Google.  The "Click-Through Rate" (CTR) indicates how often users click on your website's link in search results.  High CTR suggests relevant content and strong search ranking.  Low CTR might need improvement to your site's visibility.

### Step 4: Identify and Fix Technical SEO Issues

Search Console's "Coverage" report highlights any indexing issues, like broken links or crawl errors.  Addressing these issues is crucial for improving your search ranking.  It will also display warnings for Core Web Vitals and other technical issues.  Solving these will improve your search ranking.

### Step 5: Monitor Your Website's Performance

Regularly check Search Console for updates, new issues and your overall performance. Use the data to improve your website's SEO strategy.


**Do Now:**

1. Verify your website in Google Search Console.
2. Submit your sitemap.
3. Analyze your top search queries and click-through rate.


**Next Steps:**

* **Weekly routines:** Review top search queries list in Search Console. Analyze the keywords driving traffic and identify opportunities for content improvements.
* **Monthly analysis:** Compare organic traffic (from Google Search Console) to the previous month in Google Analytics. Analyze trends and identify areas requiring optimization.
* **Quarterly technical checks:** Fix Core Web Vitals bottlenecks identified in Search Console and Google Analytics.  Conduct a thorough review of your website's structure, links and content to ensure that you're optimizing for both search engines and users.


By implementing these steps and consistently monitoring your progress, you can significantly improve your website's visibility in Google search results and attract more Swedish customers.
